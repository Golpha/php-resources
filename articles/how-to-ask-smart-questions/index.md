## Research the problem

Read up on the problem before you ask for help, you may be able to save the time of the helper and even if the websites do not answer
your questions, you'll be better able to write good, sensible questions.

* Look for tutorials
* Do an internet research
* Look at answers to other people's questions on forums and answer sites
* Find and Read Documentation

## Ask the right people

Finding the right channel with the right people is pretty important. Also consider the complexity of the problem and the skill level
of the people you wish to ask.

## Don't ask to ask

Ask your questions directly and clearly, don't worry about asking if it's ok to ask a question. Any question is welcome, but you may
be redirected if the question is more appropriate in different channel.

## Ask everyone

It's not a good idea to address a question to a specific person, even if they've helped you in the past. Directed questions are much
less likely to be answered than open questions.

## Don't ask when busy

Group can sometimes be flooded with questions or chatter, try and find a different channel where you can get attention of people who
will be able to help.

## Be clear

Make sure you write concise and clear questions that communicate the problem you want solved. This includes versions of programs or
other details about the system you're using.

## Include purpose

Make sure to include the reason for your question, what you want to achieve with the answer. This allows the person answering your
question to provide the right solution even if it was not obvious.

## Be patient

Wait for an answer, not all users in the group are checking all the time, but they will respond when they can. Saying "Thank you"
when the question is solved can give much better image about you and warmer feeling for helpers.

Keep learning, the expert at anything was once a beginner.
