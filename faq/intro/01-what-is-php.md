Dear reader, PHP (which means recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor") is a widely-used open source general-purpose
scripting language for writing web applications, dynamically generated pages and command line interface scripts.

We believe that the best place to start with PHP is the official website [php.net][php-net] by taking some time and reading the [manual][manual].
As you will pass through the manual pages you will progress with your knowledge. Use Google search engine for most obvious issues you will find.
